This repository demonstrates an uncommon COBOL bug related to data type mismatch and an uninitialized numeric field. The program attempts to increment a numeric field that doesn't have an initial value, resulting in undefined behavior. The solution shows how to properly initialize the numeric field before using it in arithmetic operations.  This is important for ensuring program reliability and preventing unexpected errors.
